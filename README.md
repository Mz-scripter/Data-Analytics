# Data Science Learning Experience with Pandas
## Day 1
I gained experience in handling missing data (NaN values), importing data from CSV files, removing unnecessary data, selecting specific columns, identifying maximum values within datasets, and locating corresponding row indices.

## Day 2
I have acquired proficiency in utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib to transform raw data into informative visualizations. I employed pandas and matplotlib to generate a visual representation of the most widely used programming languages from 2008 to 2024.
