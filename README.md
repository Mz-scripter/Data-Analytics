# Data Science Learning Experience with Pandas
## Day 1
I gained experience in handling missing data (NaN values), importing data from CSV files, removing unnecessary data, selecting specific columns, identifying maximum values within datasets, and locating corresponding row indices.

## Day 2
I have acquired proficiency in utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib to transform raw data into informative visualizations. I employed pandas and matplotlib to generate a visual representation of the most widely used programming languages from 2008 to 2024.

## Day 3
I learnt how to:
- use HTML markdowns in Notebooks
- combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data
- use the value_counts() function
- slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation
- use the agg() function to run an operation on a particular column
- rename() columns of DataFrames
- create a linear chart with two seperate axes to visualize data that have different scales
- create a scatter plot and Bar chart in Matplotlib
- work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys
- merge() DataFrames along a particular column

  ## Day 4
  I learnt how to:
  - use .describe() to get a snapshot of your data like average, highest and lowest values
  - use .resample() to make a time-series data comparable to another by changing the periodicity.
  - work with matplotlib.dates Locators to better style a timeline (e.g., an axis on a chart).
  - find the number of NaN values with .isna().values.sum()
  - change the resolution of a chart using the figure's dpi
  -  create dashed '--' and dotted '-.' lines using linestyles
  -  use different kinds of markers (e.g., 'o' or '^') on charts.
  -  fine-tune the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linewidth and colours
  -  use .grid() to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.
